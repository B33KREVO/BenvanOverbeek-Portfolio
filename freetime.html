          <h2>My Vision</h2>
          <p>I want my designs to offer people a new lens through which they can view life. Something that not only helps them, but also challenges their assumptions and invites them to question what they once considered absolute truth. Through my work, I aim to create meaningful experiences that inspire reflection, curiosity, and a deeper understanding of the world around them.</p>

                <p>This was a project that I wanted to do for years where I painted my own skateboard with a theme of things that meant a lot to me. Unfortunately it failed as a school project but I’m still happy with the end result.</p>

                <p>In the town that I am from we have a week where we play the weirdest games in teams and every year we also need to make something for one of the games. One of the years it was a shield that someone needed to sit on. After it we also made it into a standing table.</p>

                  <p>In the dorm where I currently live, we have a shed that is only being used to store items we never use. So we decided to make a bar there for ourselves and for when we have parties. In the picture you can see the first design I made in Blender.</p>

                <p>This is a miniature model that we made during a workshop that we could sign up for. In this workshop I learned how miniatures are made for the first time. With the knowledge that we received, we started working on our own miniature. The one I ended up making was a fighting area inspired by fantasy worlds like Game of Thrones, The 100, etc.</p>

                  <p>I needed a new closet, for my old one was breaking down in some areas. However, some parts of the old closet were still intact. Seeing as I needed a nightstand next to my bed, I decided to make one out of that old closet. </p>

                <h2>Cardboard Specialist</h2>
                <p>The making of this ukulele stand was part of a project where we could only use cardboard. This includes not even using tape or glue to connect different cardboard pieces together. I achieved this with this ukulele stand by using notches, but there of course are more possible connections to be made.</p>
