                <h2>Project's Origin</h2>
                <p>
                    In the first and second year of my study we had a two week project, called freespace. Here we could do anything, we had complete freedom in what we would make within the subject of the class we chose to be in. In this second year I was in a class that revolved around art. The task we had was to research an art piece and tell the story through more senses than just hearing and seeing, but really experience the story of the art piece.

                <h2>Critical Positioning</h2>
                <p>
                    The first art piece I did research on was that of Ganz called ‘Emergence’, where two horses are sculpted in a dynamic pose that are made from plastic waste. This shows that plastic waste has its own beauty and use. The plan I had for this art piece was to collect my own plastic waste, add magnets to them and let people create their own art pieces with them. After a few days I decided to team up with someone else on another art piece that they had chosen, ‘The Persistence of Memory’ by Salvador Dali. This piece is widely known as the piece that represents surrealism, even though at the time Dali wasn’t part of the art movement of surrealism himself. Our plan to experience this painting however, was by being in it, forgetting everything that happened before or would happen afterwards and being in the moment. We wanted people to enter the world of surrealism and forget how long they were in the space themselves.

                <h2>Making</h2>
                <p>
                    To make the space that we used feel surrealistic, there were a few ideas that we had, but also added on and made changes where needed to get the beloved end result. To start off we already had a clock that looked like it was melted, just like in the painting of Dali. On this clock we mounted a servo motor that we could control with an arduino. This would allow us to design the speed and direction of which the clock would be spinning. As we were trying to take away people's awareness of time, we also did this with two other clocks that we bought, as well as make them look like they were melting. For this effect to work, we cutted the clock's edges and used clay to add the melting element. In addition we used infrared distance sensors for each clock to detect how close someone was to a certain clock. If they’d get closer the clock would move faster, the other way, or slower depending on the clock and distance. For the room itself we added objects that represented surrealism and made the space itself feel unreal. As seen in the pictures as well we used playing cards that were bigger than normal, playing cards in the shape of pizza slices, weirdly formed lamps, a stick (just like in the painting) and much more. We also had some puzzles that people could do in the room to keep them entertained while in there. For this we also had a list of possible things people could do in the room, they didn’t have to do them, those were optional. Importantly we added small couches with pillows so people could sit, with the intention to make people more comfortable and therefore making them want to stay in the room for longer. Of course we need to make the room to be closed off. For this we used a sail and cut it to our liking. We also cut out an opening that people would need to crawl through to get into the room. To finish it all off we added music to mask the sound of the servo motors as well as reinforcing the surrealism feeling of the room

                    To make sure people didn’t stay in the room too long we made sure to add a bell outside to signal to the one inside that it was time to come out of the room again. We also had a bell inside so we knew when someone wanted to leave. This came in handy because before you would go into the room itself we had a little waiting room outside where people could wait to go inside, but also put their phone, watch and anything that displayed time in our time capsule. This to make sure people had no idea how long they would be in the room. When they would get out of the room again they got a piece of paper on a clipboard to write down their name and how long they thought to be in the room for. After they wrote that down we wrote down the actual time that they were in the room for and revealed this to them. We also noted down the difference between the time guessed and actual time.
