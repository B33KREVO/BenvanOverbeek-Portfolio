          <h2>My Vision</h2>
          <p>I want my designs to offer people a new lens through which they can view life. Something that not only helps them, but also challenges their assumptions and invites them to question what they once considered absolute truth. Through my work, I aim to create meaningful experiences that inspire reflection, curiosity, and a deeper understanding of the world around them.</p>

                <p>Every year we have 2 weeks where we can make whatever we want inside a theme or idea. This time it was about telling the story behind a painting and telling it in a new way. We chose the painting The persistence of memory by Salvador Dali, and made a room that makes it feel like you are in his painting.</p>

This library knows when you are in front of it, lights up and suggests books to you based on your profile by making it light up. When picking up a book it gives information about it in the book and showcases this on the screen on the right.</p>

                      <p>This robot that I made for a project was acting more crazy the longer it was stuck in a small space in isolation. We needed to make a robot and design/code its behavior to make you feel the emotions of the robot despite having facial features. My robot went more and more crazy over time the longer it was stuck in a small space alone. Only a touch of someone else could calm it down.</p>

                      <p>Have you ever been to a party and the music was just too loud at some places? This was the mask I made that revolved around. I detected the decibel of the music and depending on how loud or quiet it was you would have different scents you would smell. Strong once to make you go to another spot and nice once to make you engaged more with the music.</p>
