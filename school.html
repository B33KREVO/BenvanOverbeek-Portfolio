          <h2>My Vision</h2>
          <p>I want my designs to offer people a new lens through which to view life. Something that not only helps them but also challenges their assumptions and invites them to question what they once considered absolute truth. Through my work, I aim to create meaningful experiences that inspire reflection, curiosity, and a deeper understanding of the world around them.</p>

                <h2>The Dream</h2>
                <p>This was a project that I wanted to do for years where I painted my own skateboard with a theme of things that meant a lot to me. Unfortunately it failed as a school project but I’m still happy with the end result.</p>

                <h2>The Room of Surrealism</h2>
                <p>Every year we have 2 weeks where we can make whatever we want inside a theme or idea. This time it was about telling the story behind a painting and telling it in a new way. We chose the painting The persistence of memory by Salvador Dali, and made a room that makes it feel like you are in his painting.</p>

                  <p>This poster was made for a project where we needed to make something that would represent us as designers. I made it with the idea of getting people to start a discussion about abortion rights, specifically in the United States, and really provoke them by what’s on the poster.</p>

                  <p>Dopamine Hit was a project where we would try to give people an nieuw perspective on the idea of secondhand clothing. We wanted to change the way people look at secondhand clothing, so that they don’t think it’s dirty, but that it has character.</p>

                      <p>ReMind was a project that focussed on making a design that would be something that could be used in the future. Our design was a device that would be worn as an accessory, where you would be able to remove small irritations so you would never have to have a bad day again.</p>

                        <p>Our Smart Library was a design to make something that already exists into a product for the future. This library knows when you are in front of it, lights up and suggests books to you based on your profile by making it light up. When picking up a book it gives information about it in the book and showcases this on the screen on the right.</p>
