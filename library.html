                <p>
                    In the world everything needs to adapt to be better, more efficient, smarter. Even a fridge is “smart”’ nowadays. Everyday items that we use are getting redesigned to fit in more with this adaptable world we are living in. For this project we were tasked to make a current system smart, that isn’t already, in a way to make the lives of us humans easier.

                <h2>Critical Positioning</h2>
                <p>
                    Since there are a lot of items that are so called ”smart” like a fridge, tap, toilet, etc, we started by asking ourselves a question, what makes something actually smart? At a surface level it's all about digital compatibility, having sensors, data collection and making decisions based on the collected data. More importantly, a smart system would be able to help us with problems that we can’t help ourselves with, so that we don’t need to involve someone else to help out. With this idea we began to look for current systems that are outdated, and may even be disappearing because of that fact. We chose the library, as this fits this description perfectly in our eyes.

                    After coming up with multiple ways to make our library “smart”, we started working on it. For the library itself I first made a rough sketch of how it should look like. We made the decision to just make one shelf, for we did not have the funding nor time to make it bigger than it came out to be. To decide the height and width of the smart library we got some books that would be used in the presentation to explain how it works and all of its features. To make the smart library we used wood. To make sure we made it perfect we measured everything precise and used milling, as well as laser cutting for some parts. In the end we connected all the parts together by sliding them in place or with a tacker, but not before painting all the parts black.

                    Afterwards we added the phone, wifi arduino and LED strip to make our smart library complete. How it works is that when you walk into a library, you would check in. After you’ve checked in, the cameras in the library can see at which bookshelf you are. The lights at the shelf would tell you which books you’ve already read, but more importantly which books are recommended to you. The recommendations are based on reviews you have put into the app of books you have previously read. Next to the shelf itself there is a screen as well, on which you can also see all the details of the book you took out of the shelf with some reviews at the bottom. If you would like to see the full functioning smart library, you can contact me.
