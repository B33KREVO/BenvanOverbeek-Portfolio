                <h2>Project's Origin</h2>
                <p>
                    At the start of this project we each were given a SDG goal. Mine was the one of ‘Good health and well-being’. We each worked on a campaign for our own subject within our given SDG, but for the main project we worked together on one of the subjects/campaigns of one out of the group we made. For the main project we chose the campaign of someone else out of my group. Their campaign was about fast fashion.

                <h2></h2>
                <p>
                    The subject that I had chosen, as for my personal campaign design, was about abortion. Abortion is a subject not talked about enough, it is seen as a taboo. This is exactly what my campaign was about, getting people, men, to talk about abortion more. The reason for this being so that women can feel more comfortable to talk about it out in the open and don’t have to carry the weight of the decision. It still very much is the decision of the woman to make the decision, but as a society we can help by talking about it more and getting rid of the taboo around the subject. If you want to know more about this campaign or my thoughts about it, you can contact me.

                <h2>Critical Positioning</h2>
                <p>
                    Fast fashion is a problem that's been around for some time now. The problems not only involve employees barely getting paid in unsafe work environments, but also the waste of all the waste it brings to the climate. So many people buy clothes online on sites like Shein and Temu, without thinking of the environmental impacts. Not only did we want to make people buy less clothes, but when they did buy clothes, make them thrift for them. Thrifting is the concept of buying second hand clothes. This is not only better for the environment, but also for your bank account, as well as that it has more character than fast fashion.

                  <h2>Making</h2>
                  <p>
                    These points are exactly what we used to try and convince people to start thrifting instead of online shopping. To achieve this we had a campaign with some points to get people to change their perspective about thrifted clothes and a part of their lifestyle. The first one being a poster for our theatrical intervention (a later point in the campaign) to get people to go there. Next up were online videos in collaboration with influencers and thrift stores to show people how many different outfits you could make with just a few pieces, as well as the character that second hand clothes have unlike fast fashion. For the theatrical intervention itself we had 5 stands with different clothing pieces on them and a QR-code in front of them. When you would scan the QR-code you’d get sent to a video with the clothing piece telling the story of the adventures that they have been on. This again shows that second hand clothes have personalities.
