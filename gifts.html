          <h2>My Vision</h2>
          <p>I want my designs to offer people a new lens through which they can view life. Something that not only helps them, but also challenges their assumptions and invites them to question what they once considered absolute truth. Through my work, I aim to create meaningful experiences that inspire reflection, curiosity, and a deeper understanding of the world around them.</p>

                <h2>Trash Taste Lamp</h2>
                <p>This lamp was a design I made for a friend that likes a podcast called ‘Trash Taste’ that I saw them watch once. I made the design with paper and then with MDF wood that I cut by hand. The wood was cut in such a way that there was only one LED strip needed, that goes through the back and lights it up on the inside and outside.</p>

                <p>This logo that is from my mother’s company is not made by me. However, I did make the sign with the use of 3D printing. With this, the logo was put onto a shape that looked good and fits with the logo itself. After it was 3D printed, I painted it and put it next the the door of the house where my mother lives.</p>

                  <p>My father must have felt left out on having a logo, because he also wanted a logo even though he doesn’t have his own business. He gave me a rough design of what he wanted and I not only made a logo, but made it in 3 days with a laser cutter as well.</p>

                  <p>This Doloris chandelier is one of my current projects that I’m working on. This design was inspired by a chandelier type object that is in the maze at Doloris. Since you can’t take pictures inside, I made my own design in Blender and made it from wood that was laser cut. This design will be fully done in about 2 weeks.</p>
