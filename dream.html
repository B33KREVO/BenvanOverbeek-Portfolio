                <h2>Project's Origin</h2>
                <p>
                    Making an escape room game was not something I ever planned to do, even though I love games, making them and playing them, as well as escape rooms. The reason that I made this escape room was for a school project. It wasn’t the main project, but just a part of it to make sure we all knew how to make games and work with programs like Blender and Unity. We needed to learn this by watching the lessons we were given or online tutorials we could find on the internet. The main project was a game as well,  where we showed a scenario that could happen in the near future in the Netherlands. For more information on that project you can take contact with me.

                <h2>Critical Positioning</h2>
                <p>
                    At the beginning of the project we also got lessons about story design, worldbuilding, game mechanics and more. We not only went into the practical theory, but also how to make it feel like you are not just in a game. For this we needed to make a story for our escape room as well, that would serve as practice for the main project. As with all school projects, I try to combine it with interests of mine, so that I give myself more motivation. With this one I used music. I also collect vinyls, which gave me the idea to use the two sides of the vinyls as opposites. There would be the A side and the B side. I didn’t know what I wanted to do with the two sides yet. As inspiration and orientation I used one of my favourite puzzle games, We Were Here. In this game series there are a lot of different sorts of puzzles, but besides that even better story design.

                <p>
                    For the story I had some ideas. One idea I had was where there would be a big figure hanging over the map that I would make for intimidation. I then had the idea to make the relationship between the one hanging over the map as teacher and student, the student being the player. I then tried making a person in Blender for the teacher, but it was a lot harder thought and not really in the style I wanted. With that I scrapped the correlation, but kept the story of the two sides of the vinyl and the student as a player. At last, I came up with the idea to make it about a dream, where the teacher left homework for the student, finding musical notes, but the second level (the B side) wouldn’t be a dream, but a nightmare.

                    As for the game I had a lot of fun making it, trying out new things, adding aspects to it etc. In the game I played around with different settings, sizes and objects. For instance, the boxes you see have different shapes, some are floating, some aren’t, some move around and rotate. On the B side I made it so that everything was spinning more and tried out different velocities for this.

                  <h2>Making</h2>
                  <p>
                    Everything that you see in the photos and that is in the game I made myself, I modeled everything myself in Blender. I started off with the main base and platform for the game, the vinyl. Not only did I make the vinyl, but in the game itself I also made it rotate including everything on it. After I made the vinyl, I started with the boxes, the walls (which are CD cases), musical notes, music sheets and the piece of paper with the “homework” on it. For the CD case I also made one that could open. This one would work as a door that could be opened to the next level and to go through to end the game. The animation for the door and the animation of the boxes floating around were made in Blender and controlled/triggered in Unity. After I had everything I made all of the connections, conditions and wrote the code to make the separate aspects of the game work together. I then began to get sound effects online for everything to bring the game to life. To finish it all off, I made it look like a dream to make it misty and like a nightmare to make it dark and blurry. If you would like to see the full game, you are free to contact me.
