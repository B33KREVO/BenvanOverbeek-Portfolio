          <h2>My Vision</h2>
          <p>I want my designs to offer people a new lens through which to view life. Something that not only helps them but also challenges their assumptions and invites them to question what they once considered absolute truth. Through my work, I aim to create meaningful experiences that inspire reflection, curiosity, and a deeper understanding of the world around them.</p>

                <h2>Trash Taste Lamp</h2>
                <p>This lamp was a design I made for a friend that likes a podcast called ‘Trash Taste’ that I saw them watch once. I made the design with paper and then with MDF wood that I cut by hand. The wood was cut in such a way that there was only one LED strip needed, that goes through the back and lights it up on the inside and outside.</p>

                <p>In my town where I am from we have a week where we play the weirdest games in teams and every year we also need to make something for one of the games. One of the years it was a shield where someone needed to sit on. After it we also made it into a standing table.</p>

                  <p>My father must have felt left out, because he also wanted a logo even though he doesn’t have his own business. He gave me a rough design of what he wanted and I not only made a logo, but made it in 3 with a laser cutter as well.</p>

                  <p>This Doloris chandelier is one of my current projects that I’m working on. This design was inspired by a chandelier type object that is in the maze at Doloris. Since you can’t take pictures inside, I made my own design in Blender and made it from wood that was laser cut. This design will be fully done in about 2 weeks.</p>
