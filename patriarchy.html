                <p>
                    For this project we needed to make something that would represent who we were as CMD designers. This would not only be who we were as designers, but also who we wanted to be, what is important to us and the kind of products we would want to make. In the first year we also had a similar project at which I made a fidget tool. You can read more about that project on this <a href="fidget.html">here</a>.

                <h2>Critical Positioning</h2>
                <p>
                    With the questions of who we are/want to be as designers I started by going through all of the projects I had done previously, stating what tools I used for them, the subject it was about, how much I enjoyed it and what things could’ve gone better. Having this knowledge helped me identify what I wanted to incorporate more into my projects. I also chose 5 words for my core values that resonated the most. I used them as reference points to see if the concepts I had were within what I wanted to show off myself. The words I used were efficiency, openness, joy, empathy and independence. Between the words I also wrote down some connections to go more in the details. During this time I was following a lot of the news as well, which were a lot about the elections in the USA. With all of this I wanted to make a mark. I wanted to make something that would make people rethink their perspective and make them go into discussions. This would be achieved through designs that question current social issues and society as a whole.

                <h2>Experimenting</h2>
                <p>
                    Since there were a lot of news programs and social platforms about the elections in the USA and even more after the elections. So I decided to make something revolving around this. With research I had done, there were a few things that I used in my designs. The first one being about books that Trump would ban and use censorship, because these books had to do with race, sexism and the LGBTQIA+ community. In reality they had no right to be banned. For this I made a design with some of the books being wrongfully banned, ordered them and put an ‘Banned’ stamp across them with a dear Trump within the stamp.

                <h2></h2>
                <p>
                    The other was one about something Nick Fuentes said in a video that went viral. After Trump won the election, he was saying things like “Your body, my choice” and “We control your body”, making fun of women and not being able to choose for themselves if they could have abortion or not. For this one I made 2 main designs that I later made iterations on. The first one being one of a house that is on fire we the words ‘Your house, our choice’. This one came from the fact that Nick Fuentes address got leaked after the video and his house was burned down by someone. The second one being that of the classic Uncle Sam poster with the ‘We want you…’. I used it in a provocative way, trying to make people angry and talkative about the subject by changing the quote to ‘We want you body for us’ or ‘Your body, my choice’, and iterations of this.

                  <p>
                    In the end I made the decision to go with a poster for the design for a number of reasons. With the Uncle Sam idea it already made sense to make a poster as well, but it would also have the option to make copies of it to hang around the city and make people see it and make them talk about it. It would get people up and talk about it, have discussions, to not nudge it away like another weird thing that happens in the USA. The final result is the poster with the Uncle Sam design and the quote ‘We want YOUR body, for U.S.’. I chose this design because from the feedback that I received this one got the reaction I was aiming for. It also resembles the original quote the most, and I used the ‘U.S.’ as ‘us’ and as ‘United States’.
