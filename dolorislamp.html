                <h2>Project's Origin</h2>
                <p>
                    The start of this project began at Doloris Meta Maze in Tilburg. I visited the Maze with a friend of mine. What stood out to us was that one of the rooms in the Maze had a type of chandelier, with several LED strips hanging from it. The LED strips overlapped, and were individually coded per LED, the light patterns adapted to the music/ambiance of the room, unfortunately I was not able to gather any footage, because phones are not allowed inside the Maze. The friend with whom I visited the Maze mentioned that she'd like a chandelier like that for her own room.

                <h2>Critical Positioning</h2>
                <p>
                    Since I've been advancing my abilities and experience with design more and more, I often find myself contemplating whether I can make the things I see myself. This however was a different case than usual because it was art, and I would have to create a similar design based solely on memory, and use the image I had in my head, from when I was in the maze, with no further reference to develop a design. Still I was determined to design and make this for my friend and so I began the process.

                <h2>Experimenting</h2>
                <p>
                    The day after visiting the Maze, I started working on a sketch to visualize what I remembered the chandelier to look like, I quickly realised it wasn't easy for me to put all the interesting and confusing design features on paper. I decided it might be better to make a model in Blender. This made everything that much easier to clarify, even when it came to 3D design. I used the skills I picked up from my escape room project, to create a visual of my interpretive design of the chandelier, following that I made some adjustments, such as finding a way to incorporate the name of the person, whom I'm making this chandelier for, into the design.

                  <h2>Making</h2>
                  <p>
                    For the making of the parts I had to be very precise to make sure all of the measurements matched the initial calculations of the design. To be as precise as possible I used a laser cutting device. I started with the middle of the chandelier and some extra parts surrounding it to test if everything was as expected, and then continued laser cutting the rest of the parts for the chandelier. It was now finally time to start the assembly of all of the chandelier parts, this process wasn't very difficult but did require good concentration to make sure all of the pieces were attached as straight as possible, this ended up taking up a lot more time than I initially anticipated, once this step was completed I sanded all of the parts individually.

                  <p>
                    After assembling all of the individual chandelier parts it was now time to assemble the actual chandelier. The process of this generally went by a lot faster, I did however face some difficulties with tacking some of the pieces together, because the wood tacker wasn't always able to reach them properly, after some force I was able to tack all of the pieces together successfully. When the full frame design was completed, it was time for me to start painting it, I wanted the chandelier to be black so that it wouldn't be very noticeable at night unless you turned its lights on, the shiny finish of the black paint also reflects the lights and colours from the LEDs which creates a cool effect. I started the painting process with two coats of white paint instead of going straight in with black paint because materials such as wood tend to suck up moistures like paint, and therefore the black would have a nicer finish with a white base underneath.
