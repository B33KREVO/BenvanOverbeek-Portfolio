                <h2>Project's Origin</h2>
                <p>
                    With birthdays I am someone who makes something for people that they can't buy anywhere. Besides that, when it comes to friends and people I care about in general, I tend to remember everything they tell me about themselves (what they like, certain stories, favourite's of something, etc). With this gift, I saw a glimpse of them watching a podcast called Trash Taste, that I happen to know and enjoy myself as well. Months later their birthday was coming up and I remembered that detail, so I thought it would be fun to give them something Trash Taste related.

                <h2>Critical Positioning</h2>
                <p>
                    I started by doing research on official and unofficial Trash Taste merchandise that was already available online for purchase. After seeing lots of different types of merchandise I didn't quite know what I should make, but then I saw a wall lamp in my sister’s room and an idea came to mind. The idea to make a wall lamp, with underglow, in the shape of the Trash Taste podcasts logo.

                <h2>Experimenting</h2>
                <p>
                    At first I was thinking of just a simple flat lamp in the logo of the podcast, but came to the realization that it would look dull if I were to make it like that. So I thought of adding layers to it, tested this with paper at first and then made the choice to make a base with elevated pieces on top of that. Not only that, but also making smaller parts for the elevated parts to give it even more dimensions. With the elevation in some parts, I came to the realization that I was able to do an innerglow as well.

                  <h2>Making</h2>
                  <p>
                    With all the ideas now finalized, I started making the actual lamp itself, starting with frame/background, all the parts and elevations. Before going further, I needed to make a backside for the LED strip to attach and secure it. This also needed to be placed in a way so I would have an outer- and an innerglow. After I sawed every piece that I was going to use in the design, I painted them white, and later purple for the background. Once this all dried, I was able to attach it all to one another, as well as the LED strip to the back and finish the product.
