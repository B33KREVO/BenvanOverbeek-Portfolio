                <h2>Project's Origin</h2>
                <p>
                    As a child I had a skateboard and loved to skate. A long time passed without skating or thinking about it, but then I began to watch more skating content online and even bought my own skateboard. I bought one that was fully white with the intention to paint it myself, or at least make a design, because I had a friend who painted their own and other people's skateboards. About 4 years go by and I still have not painted a single swipe on my skateboard. It took a while, but now I finally had the time, money and motivation to start.

                <h2>Critical Positioning</h2>
                <p>
                    At the start of this project I had done research not only on existing designs online, but also on myself, and what kind of person I am. I reflected on who I was as a person, who I wanted to be, what I enjoyed and what was important for me. I wanted the design to be something I could look at and be proud of, to see my most important interests. Besides self-reflecting, I did research on design I could find online as well. The ones that stood out to me I redesigned myself or were used for inspiration. The 4 interests that I decided were to represent me the most were; space, music, (old) technology and languages.

                <h2>Experimenting</h2>
                <p>
                    With the designs I found online I started drawing them on a skateboard to visualize how they would look. I used inspiration from what I had researched before as well as little drawings or symbols from my interests that I found. With that I made all of these designs. Some are more detailed than others, but more detail doesn’t have to mean better. I was trying out loads of different aspects, mostly outside of the 4 interests, with other things that I liked. In the end I made a design that incorporated my interests and combined the old technology with music through a cassette. I also thought about making the planets look like vinyls, but didn’t follow through with it because it wouldn’t look enough like planets if I chose to do that.

                  <h2>Making</h2>
                  <p>
                    The making of the actual design on the board was pretty straight forward. I started off by getting rid of the wheels, covering the baseplate (metal part that connects the wheels) with tape and cleaning the board. I then began to sand the board and put on two layers of white before adding any colours. For this project I used spray paint with some acrylic paint as well. Using the white as base layers did not only make the colour on top of it stand out more, but would also get rid of the brand name on the side. Next up I painted the background black and then it was time to make the planets. For this idea I saw some options online from a video of how to do it on a canvas. The way it's done is by mixing colours in a small area and then pressing on it with a rippled piece of paper and twisting it. You then make these colour mixes round by using basic objects from the house, putting them on top of the colour mix and spraying black paint around it. After I did this for every planet I “protected” the planet paintings with the objects from before so I could add stars.

                  <p>
                    The stars were made by spraying some white paint on my finger (I had gloves on) and flicking it on the board. With this the white paint scattered over the board and gave the effect of stars in space. Lastly I added the cassette on the board. I first drew it with a pencil and then painted it on to the board. Within the cassette I also added 5 words that were important to me as a person in all the languages I knew or was learning at the time. These words are: 愉快, 공감, loyalität, ouverture, connectedness; meaning, joy, empathy, loyalty, openness and of course connectedness. To finish it off I added a clear layer on top of it to protect the design for when I use the board to skate.
