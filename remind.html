                <h2>Project's Origin</h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first project I had as a CMD student. The project was about who we wanted to be as CMD designers, what kind of things we wanted to make and for who we wanted to do this for.

                <h2>Critical Positioning</h2>
                <p>
                    We had some exercises to get to know ourselves better. We needed to write who we are, what the best and worst scenarios would be, our interests and core values. I myself wanted to be a designer that would help others that needed it, people with (learning) disabilities for instance. The one I would focus on for this project was ADHD. I myself knew a lot of people with ADHD and had already done quite some research prior to this project. To get data about people with and without ADHD I put out a questionnaire. In addition I observed people at my school and noted down the type of fidgeting they were doing (tapping their foot, playing with a pen, biting nails, etc). Furthermore, I watched some videos of people reviewing fidget toys and tools, and noted down the feedback they had on the specific item.

                <p>
                    At first I had some ideas that just revolved around my interests. One of them being a card game to get to know someone through songs. You would have multiple stages each one being a question on a deeper level. The way to answer the questions is with a song. Another one was about me making a photo series of things that were important to me. I didn’t work more on that and quickly focused on something else. Later on I started to focus more on the ADHD ideas and how to make the most of a learning disability like that. Through research I knew a lot of people, even if not all had ADHD, were already fidgeting in their own way. The many fidgets toys already available all had their pros and cons. I started sketching some ideas for tools that could be an option like a lava lamp hourglass, spinner ring and two rotating tubes. When I had a final design I made it and tested around with different textures for which felt the best and tested it on people at my school.

                  <h2>Making</h2>
                  <p>
                    The way I could help people was by making a fidget tool that could help them focus better while working. For this to work I had given myself a few requirements. It needed to be silent to not distract others from their work. The tool needed to be usable in one hand to be able to do other work in the other hand if needed, as well as being small enough to bring to any occasion. For the feel and texture of fidget I wanted it to feel relaxing and not too cold or warm. Most importantly, it needs to help someone focus better. With these requirements I made the fidget that you see in the photo. I had chosen this design for the reason that it had the best features from already existing tools with improvements. The design would normally just be two small balls to circle around in one's hand, but with this design they are connected. This makes it so that it's not possible for one of the balls to fall on the ground. If the fidget as a whole would fall to the ground it also wouldn’t make that much noise because of the soft material. Furthermore, it also had springs inside to be able to bring the balls closer and further away, which would make it easier to roll them around in one's hand. You could also use it to do the clicking motion of a pen.
