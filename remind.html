                <p>
                    In collaboration with the Amphia Hospital in Breda we got assigned with a project, to make a speculative design. The theme we got to work in was that of Biomedia and Bio-engineering. The speculative design that we needed to make was required to be a probable design created with the vision to benefit the medical healthcare sector.

                <h2>Critical Positioning</h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever wanted to erase a bad memory, get rid of daily irritation, or maybe just for recreational purposes? This is what we asked people for our project. Mental health issues is a subject that has always caught my interest. With this question we wanted to get more specific with the orientation of our project, by seeing if people would actually be interested in a device that could erase your memory. We also had a follow up question to get to know the reason why people would do it, and how they wanted to use it specifically. After we were sure that this had potential, we started doing loads of research about how this could medically be possible in the near future. The three main options we found in research were through the use of TMS(Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation)/DBS(Deep Brain Stimulation), EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) or hormone manipulation. Hormone manipulation would work with the use of neurochemistry. With the use of this through medicine, genetic modification would be possible. The genetic modification would be used to weaken or erase a specific memory's chemical that was made at the moment the memory was made.

                <p>
                    With EMDR there are a lot of different possibilities. It's not just the flashing of light, like most people think of, but uses sound pulses and vibrations as well. TMS or DBS is the use of presize electrical stimulations, through the usage of electrical pulses. Using these two together while thinking about the memory you would want to erase, there would be the possibility to actually  erase that memory completely, or not... In this case it would work by getting rid of the neurotransmitter that is the bridge to that memory. The memory itself will not be damaged, but the neurotransmitter to get it, to be able to re-call the memory, would be destroyed. This is done by the use of electrical pulses, while the neurotransmitter to a certain memory is active. This tactic with the use of flashing lights or vibrations of EMDR, to disorient the user for a moment, could in theory work in the near future.

                <h2>Experimenting</h2>
                <p>
                    With the earlier talked about ways to possibly erase someone's memory, we designed some concepts for prototypes. For hormone manipulation we didn't come further than the use of pills. Other designs were also not speculative enough in the design themselves. We were still very interested with the possibilities that this option could bring in the future from the research we had done. In contrast, for the EMDR design options, we had a lot more that would be visually reinforcing the speculative look enough in that of our interest as well as the project's benefit. In the designs we made the decision to have them be like some sort of accessory. The reason for this being that in our data we found that most people would use a device that could erase your memory, mostly for minor inconveniences or small irritations.

                  <h2>Making</h2>
                  <p>
                    We decided through trial and error to go with the design of a head accessory that uses electrical pulses and vibrations. At the start, to make sure it would have the desired effect, we tested the vibrations on the outside of the headband that we would be using. We put a vibration motor on each end of the headband. To activate them we connected the minus cable both to one end of each respective battery and had the plus cable hover above the other side of the battery, so when you pressed on it, it would connect and vibrate. Later on we incorporated it into the headband itself, with markers to know where to press to activate the headband. Lights on the sides were added in addition to let others know when someone else would be using the headband to erase a memory. The intention for this was to not erase every detail ever by making people self-aware about using it, because we believe that even small things make you who you are. To add on, we also made an application that is used in combination with the headband itself. Want to know more about the research done or other aspects of this project? Feel free to contact me.
